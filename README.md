# Birthday-Wish-using-Python
<h1>This is an python wrapper !!!</h1> 
Made by *Lakshmi deepak* Use this wrapper for birthday wishes to your friend in a different way using python.  
Firstly, what you have to do is? You have to install the required packages, don't worry about the code and blabla things.
I made it simple for you. 

First download this wrapper, extract it, open the folder. Open the terminal in these location. and run    

**_pip install -r requirements.txt_**   

and don't forget to connect the internet to your lap.....  
and then made changes in artfies located in arts folder, I have given a plain art for you and plainart with extra decorations too add the colors to your wish.    
and change the artfile in config.py, it is set to default change it to plainart or plainartwithstars, where you made the changes and added colors.  
Follow the color codes to add colors.    

you can change the speed of art in config.py by reducing the speed value, you increase the speed of art. Same for coding speed to, 0.001 is defualt value 

at last run the     

**_python3 main.py_**        

in the these location terminal to see the art....  

<h1>There is another method to run</h1>
